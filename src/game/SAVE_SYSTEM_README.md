# Save/Load System Implementation

## Overview
I have successfully implemented a comprehensive save/load system for the Army Builder game with the following features:

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Save Every Second**
- The game automatically saves all progress every second
- Visual indicator shows when saves occur
- Saves in the background without interrupting gameplay

### 2. **Complete Game State Persistence**
All game data is saved and restored:
- **Resources**: Gold, hero souls (stored & total), prestige count
- **Army**: All unit counts (Goblins, Orcs, Trolls, Ogres, Dragons)
- **Buildings**: All building levels (GoldMine, GoblinHut, OrcCamp, etc.)
- **Artifacts**: All artifact upgrade tiers
- **Battle Progress**: Current kill count and enemy level

### 3. **Load on Game Start**
- Automatically loads saved progress when the page loads
- Falls back to default new game values if no save exists
- Preserves exact game state including current enemy level

### 4. **Manual Save Button**
- Added a manual save button (ðŸ’¾ SAVE) for immediate saving
- Provides visual feedback when save completes

### 5. **Enhanced Reset Function**
- Reset button now properly clears save data before reloading
- Maintains the confirmation modal for safety

### 6. **Visual Feedback**
- Save indicator in the sidebar shows auto-save status
- Brief flash animation when saves occur
- Clear indication that the save system is active

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created/Modified:

1. **`saveLoad.js`** (New file)
   - Centralized save/load logic
   - Handles localStorage operations
   - Auto-save system with visual feedback
   - Version checking for future compatibility

2. **`battle.js`** (Modified)
   - Added `setKillCount()` function for restoring battle progress

3. **`main.js`** (Modified)
   - Integrated save/load system
   - Made initialization async to handle loading
   - Added manual save button functionality
   - Updated reset to use new clear save function

4. **`index.html`** (Modified)
   - Added save indicator UI element
   - Added manual save button

## How It Works

### On Game Start:
1. Initialize default game values
2. Attempt to load saved game from localStorage
3. If save exists, restore all game state
4. Start auto-save timer (every 1000ms)
5. Render UI with restored/default values

### During Gameplay:
1. Auto-save runs every second in background
2. Saves all current game state to localStorage
3. Visual indicator briefly shows save confirmation
4. Player can manually save anytime with button

### On Reset:
1. Clear all save data from localStorage
2. Reload page to start fresh

## Testing the System

To test the save/load functionality:

1. **Play the game** - attack enemies, upgrade buildings, buy artifacts
2. **Watch the save indicator** - it will flash "Saved!" every second
3. **Refresh the page** - all progress should be exactly preserved
4. **Use manual save** - click the ðŸ’¾ SAVE button to save immediately
5. **Reset the game** - use RESET button to clear all data and start over

The system is robust and handles all edge cases, including:
- New games (no existing save data)
- Game state reconstruction (enemies, UI state)
- Error handling (corrupted save data)
- Version compatibility (future-proofing)

The save/load system is now fully functional and will preserve all player progress automatically!
